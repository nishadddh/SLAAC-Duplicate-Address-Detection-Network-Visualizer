Enhanced Security in IPv6 Address Generation (Research Paper Result)

This project presents the results of my research paper on improving IPv6 address security. I developed a strengthened address-generation algorithm to mitigate privacy leaks and predictable SLAAC patterns. Using Python, cryptographic hashing, and randomized identifiers, I evaluated its resistance to prediction attacks and demonstrated measurable improvements over standard IPv6 addressing.
